SESSION COMPLETE.

Run the **Wisdom Harvest** skill as defined in `.agent/skills/wisdom-harvest/SKILL.md`.

1. **Extract** general principles from this session using the 3-Gate test (Non-obvious, Pain-tested, Transferable).
2. **Add survivors** to `.agent/alignment/pearls.md`. Discard rocks. Promote existing pearls if confirmed again.
3. **Update** `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` with a crystal clear "Next Step" for the next agent.
4. **Append** any new EpicTours-specific UI patterns or anti-patterns to `docs/CODING_PATTERNS.md` or `docs/ANTI_PATTERNS.md` (these are project-specific, they do NOT go into pearls.md).
5. **Report** exactly what was added to each document.
