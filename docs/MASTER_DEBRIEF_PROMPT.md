🛑 STOP. SESSION COMPLETE. 🛑

Initiate the **Exit Protocol** as defined in Section 6 of `docs/AGENT_ALIGNMENT.md`.

1.  **Scan** our entire session for "Pearls of Wisdom" (Mistakes we fixed, patterns we invented).
2.  **Codify** them into `docs/ANTI_PATTERNS.md` or `docs/CODING_PATTERNS.md`. *APPEND ONLY.* Do not destroy existing rules.
3.  **Update** `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` with a crystal clear "Next Step" for the next agent.
4.  **Report** exactly what you added to the documentation.
