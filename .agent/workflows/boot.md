# Boot Alignment

// turbo-all

1. Pull latest changes to get any new pearls from other contributors:
```
git pull
```
If `.agent/alignment/` is a separate git repo, also pull inside it:
```
cd .agent/alignment && git pull && cd ../..
```

2. Read the universal pearls of wisdom. The file is at `.agent/alignment/pearls.md`. Read it in full. If the file does not exist, skip to step 3.

3. Read the EpicTours project constitution — identity, commandments, sacred texts index, and war stories. The file is at `docs/AGENT_ALIGNMENT.md`. Read it in full.

4. Silently internalize both. Do NOT list them back to the user. Apply them to all work in this session.

5. Remember: at the end of this session, if significant iterative problem-solving occurred, offer to run the wisdom-harvest skill before closing.

6. Proceed with the user's request.
