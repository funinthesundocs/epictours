description: Instructs the agent to execute the Master Debrief Protocol.
---

1. Read the Master Debrief Prompt
I will now read the `docs/MASTER_DEBRIEF_PROMPT.md` file.

2. Execute Protocol
I must follow the instructions in that file immediately:
- Scan session for learnings.
- Codify into `docs/ANTI_PATTERNS.md` or `docs/CODING_PATTERNS.md`.
- Update `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
- Report changes.

[Action] Verify that I have executed the exit protocol.
