description: Instructs the agent to execute the Master Alignment Protocol.

1. Read the Master Alignment Prompt
I will now read the `docs/MASTER_ALIGNMENT_PROMPT.md` file.

2. Execute Protocol
I must follow the instructions in that file immediately:
- Read `docs/AGENT_ALIGNMENT.md`.
- Read `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
- State "Neural Sync Complete".

[Action] Verify that I have read these files and confirm alignment.
