# Collective Wisdom System

This folder contains organizational knowledge that grows with every work session.

**What it is:** Generalizable principles extracted from real work — not project logs, not meeting notes. Universal rules that help any agent on any project.

**How it grows:** At the end of any significant session, run the `wisdom-harvest` skill (say "harvest"). The agent extracts general principles, tests them against a 3-gate quality standard, and adds survivors here.

**How to start:** Run `/boot` at the beginning of any session. The agent reads all accumulated pearls and applies them silently.

**Quality standard:** Every pearl must pass 3 gates — Non-obvious, Pain-tested, Transferable. See `.agent/skills/wisdom-harvest/SKILL.md` for the full process.

**What does NOT belong here:** Project-specific details, client names, filenames, syntax trivia, or anything you could find on Stack Overflow in 10 seconds.
